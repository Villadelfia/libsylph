/**
 * @file
 * @headerfile Sylph.h
 * This file is a shortcut to include many commonly used headers. Actually, it
 * will include the following headers (relative to @c Sylph/Core):
 * <code><ul>
 * <li>Any.h</li>
 * <li>Application.h</li>
 * <li>Array.h</li>
 * <li>ByteBuffer.h</li>
 * <li>Dictionary.h</li>
 * <li>Exception.h</li>
 * <li>File.h</li>
 * <li>I18N.h</li>
 * <li>PointerManager.h</li>
 * <li>Primitives.h</li>
 * <li>Range.h</li>
 * <li>String.h</li>
 * <li>StringBuffer.h</li>
 * <li>Util.h</li>
 * <li>Vector.h</li>
 * </ul></code>
 * It also has 'using' statements for following classes:
 * <code><ul>
 * <li>Sylph::Array</li>
 * <li>Sylph::Dictionary</li>
 * <li>Sylph::String</li>
 * <li>Sylph::range</li>
 * </ul></code>
 * You can turn this of by defining the macro @c SYLPH_NO_COMMON_USING before
 * inclusion.
