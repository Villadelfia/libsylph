/**
 * Class representing an application. An application a combination of an
 * executable file with any resources required to run it.<p>
 * An executable file is any file containing executable object code that can be
 * directly invoked by the operating system through a well-defined entry point.
 * Probably the most important example of an instance of this class is
 * @c a pointer to an Application object representing the application from
 * which it is dereferenced.<p>
 * An application is considered <i>relocatable</i> if and only if, once built
 * for a specific target, the application can be run from any absolute path
 * on that target and can be run on any other compatible system, without
 * needing to be rebuilt.
 * An application is considered <i>self-contained</i> if and only if the
 * application ships with all required resources and frameworks, except for
 * standard or very common libraries, all these files are in one directory
 * hierarchy and this directory hierarchy is not shared with other applications.
 * Futhermore, each self-contained application must be relocatable.
 * It is not possible to directly instantiate an Application object. Future
 * releases may contain functions to create Application objects and run the
 * accompanying object code.
