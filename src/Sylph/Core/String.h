 * The String class represents character strings. All strings used in LibSylph

 * Strings are constant, their value can not be changed after they are created.
 * StringBuffer implements a mutable string. The copy constructor only copies
 * a pointer to the actual internal data, making Strings trivial to copy,
 * they should therefore be treated as built-in types, such as ints and floats.
 * <p>The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of
 * the sequence, for comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting
 * substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters
 * translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping relies heavily on the
 * information provided by the Unicode Consortium's Unicode 5.1 specification.
 * The specification's UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt files are used
 * extensively to provide case mapping. For specific details, please refer
 * to the ICU library documentation.<p>
 * Strings are encoded internally in UTF-16, but only the Basic Multilinguar
 * Plane (up to U+FFFF) is supported. Future versions may add support for the
 * other planes (up to U+10FFFF). In this case, UTF-32 will be used instead.
