 * Array2d is a two-dimensional array. Unlike a traditional C-style or even
 * LibSylph-style (i.e. <code>Array<Array<T>></code>), it is backed only by a single
 * array and therefore gives faster access to the data. Example:
 * <pre>
 * // create a 3x4 array
 * Array2d<int>(3,4) myarr; // this will initialize everything to zero
 *
 * // access element at 1,2
 * myarr(1,2) = 5;
 *
 * // access element beyond scope
 * try {
 *     myarr(3,4) = 2;
 * catch(...) {
 *      thisapp->fail("Oops! couldnt do that!");
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Unline a one-dimensional Array, this array is not reference-counted and
 * should be passed by reference to functions.
