/**
 * Wrapper class for any kind of class. Any allows you to wrap any kind of class
 * in it, in other words, it acts as an universal supertype. It is similar to
 * what <code>void*</code> was used in C, but safer to use (wrong casts return
 * a null pointer instead of a corrupted pointer). Any is useful for using in
 * collections, it will allow any kind of object to be stored in a single
 * collection. Other languages or toolkits use a superclass for this purpose,
 * (e.g. Object), but this does not take primitive or alien (i.e. from another
 * API) types into account. Any can be used safely for such purposes and is
 * recommended over <code>void*</code> or Object. <p>
 * An example of a predefined collection using Any is Dictionary, which acts
 * as a HashMap of String,Any.
