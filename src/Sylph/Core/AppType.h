 * This enumeration contains the possible Application Types. Each element
 * is backed by an implementation of @c ApplicationSelf in @c Sylph::OS.<p>
 * When you want to use an alternative implementation of @c ApplicationSelf,
 * you can pass one of the elements of this enumeration as the definition
 * of the macro <code>APP_TYPE</code> to the compiler, e.g. for GCC:
 * <pre>g++ -o myapp -lSylph -DAPPTYPE=S_APPTYPE_FHS myapp.cpp</pre>
 * Note that this usage is not checked, i.e. with this command you can
 * compile perfectly on Mac %OS X or Windows, but <code>S_APPTYPE_FHS</code>
 * only works on Linux, but this error will not be reported. Therefore
 * using this kind of override requires support for a dynamic configuration
 * system, such as <i>GNU Autotools</i> or <i>CMake</i>
