This "code" is here purely to have doxygen generate documentation. It is not
used by anything else in LibSylph and will never be compiled. In fact, it
probably won't even compile.

The documentation generated here is for the various "concepts", or standardized
interfaces a class in LibSylph can comply to. Often, you'll find that a piece of
documentation says that a function or an object should comply to the
such-and-such concept. To know what that means, check the documentation
generated from this directory.
